                <h3>Our Achievements</h3>
                <strong>2019</strong>

We develop a culture of excellence that includes a robust instructional program aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) with a focus on implementing Balanced Literacy through Reading and Writing Workshop, as well as by building language, literacy and competency across all subject areas. This includes the integration of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) into the curriculum and by establishing a strong culture and climate.</p>
                <strong>2020</strong>
                <p>To this end, we seek to develop well-rounded students who exemplify health, wellness and character development using our core schoolwide expectations and values (Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible and Be Mindful).</p>
                <strong>2021</strong>
                <p>Through discovery, exploration, innovation, and creative expression through Arts integration and after school enrichment opportunities, students receive rich, extended learning opportunities while building a positive school culture where every member feels valued and respected.</p>
                <strong>2022</strong>
                <p>Through coaching, collaboration and building professional learning communities, we offer staff professional development training to build teachers capacity to improve instructional practices and to accelerate student achievement.
 
                  Finally, we support a community schools approach that organizes and maximizes resources from the school and community based partnerships to ensure every student thrives and to support student success in alignment with the school priorities. </p>
