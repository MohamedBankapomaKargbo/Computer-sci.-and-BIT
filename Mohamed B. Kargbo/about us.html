  <p class="pp">The Bo Government Secondary School commonly known as Bo School is a secondary school located on a 13.5 acres (5.5 ha) property in the center of Bo, the second largest city in Sierra Leone. The school was founded in 1906 at the behest of the British colonial governor, Leslie Probyn, to educate the sons of Paramount Chiefs or nominees of Paramount Chiefs. The school later evolved to became a public school that is open to boys from all backgrounds.

    Bo school is a boys-only boarding school. The pupils live in the four dormitory buildings (called Towns) on the school's campus. The four dormitories are called Manchester, London, Liverpool, and Paris respectivelyâ€”the first three are named after famous cities in England, and the last is named after capital of France.</p>
